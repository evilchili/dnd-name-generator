### Abyssal

Low-ranking demons speak in a guttural, broken dialect that is louder and more
consonant, like dogs barking. The written language and naming conventions
reflect the more refined language of demons, a quiet, sibilant susurrus that
sounds at times like waves, at others like buzzing, keening insects.
