### Elvish

> The Elvish tongue flows like a river and pools upon the lips like sweetest wine. -- Anwin am Vakaralithien

Elvish is an ornate, multisyllabic language featuring a complex and nuanced set
of vowel sounds that can take non-native speakers decades to master. Surnames
are typically derived from place names; the more noble the name, the more
baroque its construction.
