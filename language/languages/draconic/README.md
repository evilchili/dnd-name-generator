### Draconic

The tongue of dragons and the Dragonborn. It is punctuated by low, gutteral
grunts denoted by an apostrophe ('), the particular inflections of which can
change the meaning of an utterance dramatically. When shouting, a speaker of
Draconic should accentuate these grunts with spurts of flame, acid, ice, and so
on.

The high form is reserved for the names of nobility -- that is, dragons -- who
typically choose an appelation for themselves in the common tongue, the better
to spread the terror of their name.
