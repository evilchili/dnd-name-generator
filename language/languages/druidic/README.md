### Druidic

On Vosh, the continent comprising the eastern hemisphere of Telisar, Ti'Anar is the language of the Malseid, a race of centuar-like camel/humanoid hybrids native to the Sahwat Desert. The Malseid's ancient traditions have been denigrated by certain so-called learned men of the cities as "pagan nonsense" and falsely associated with both primitive mysticism and eco-terrorism, thus the term *Druidic*. Caring little for what outsiders think, Malseid do not bother to correct this ignorance.

*Se'emui uas luulc mich. Co'ade tomr dur feinuh. Naillig mur log sudds! Taocih baamug luhs uit, muucu nuiboh paitut? Laiddu gaitot toirii simt ur!*
