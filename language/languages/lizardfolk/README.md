### Lizardfolk

The Lizardfolk language is a unique form of telepathy borne by pheramonne
exchange. It is literally impossible for non-Lizardfolk to speak it, though
with practice they can learn to recognize particular smells. Lizardfolk names
are collections of scent pattterns, the first of which denotes the Lizardfolk's
family origins.
