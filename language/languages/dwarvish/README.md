### Dwarvish

Dwarvish words are short, sharp, and to the point. Much like the Dwarves
themselves. This is "Low Dwarvish"; an ancient form of High Dwarvish still
exists in some regions, notably the Dewa Q'Asos area of southern Vosh, but it
is considered "dead" by most scholars and is reserved for arcane legal
contracts (and those signifying a high social status).

*Dowêchâ khâ, natu phe tu, futê dêdachî pê she wu?*

**Dwarvish Names:**
* "Black" Yzh Se
