### Infernal

The language of devils is a collection of gutteral barks that is unmistakable,
and unmistakably terrifying, to the ear of common folk. Traditional names
typically begin with the name of the ruler of whatever circle of Hell the devil
calls home, but some Tieflings (and others of Infernal origin) reject their
Infernal legacies and choose less noble names.
